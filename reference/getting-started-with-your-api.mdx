### Welcome!

Welcome to WalletKit! Our API is designed to simplify your web3 development journey. We're excited to show you how WalletKit can help you build amazing decentralized experiences, without requiring you to be a crypto expert. Our developer-centric approach offers easy-to-use, HTTP-based APIs for seamless integration and fast-paced development.

We understand that web3 development can be complex. To reduce that complexity, WalletKit provides higher-level abstractions over wallets, tokens, and NFTs. This way, you can focus on creating and innovating, even if you're new to the crypto world.

So why wait? Start building with WalletKit today and streamline your path to crafting web3 experiences with wallets, tokens, and NFTs. We can't wait to see what you create!
