title: "Batch Transfer Token"
---

This endpoint does batch transfers from the `from` wallet to the list of `recipient`s with the provided `amount`. The `from` address can only be the ones created in the project. Transfers within a batch are processed atomically in a single transaction, resulting in significantly lower average costs compared to individual transfers
