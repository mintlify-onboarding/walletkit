title: "Upload NFT image"
---

This endpoint facilitates uploading the image to IPFS and returns an IPFS URI, which can be used in the NFT mint endpoint. 

The metadata for NFTs is stored off-chain, while the pointer of the metadata (such as the URI of the image) is stored on-chain. You can host the image on a centralized service like Amazon S3 or store it on IPFS, a decentralized storage system that ensures immutability.
