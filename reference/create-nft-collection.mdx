This endpoint creates an NFT Collection with provided metadata.

An NFT collection refers to a group of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are created and released together, often following a specific theme or concept. NFTs are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain, represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular item, artwork, or digital content.

The created nft collection's address can be found by [/transactions/status-by-id](/reference/get-transaction-status-by-id) endpoint once the transaction is succeeded.
