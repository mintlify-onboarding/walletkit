WalletKit offers an extensive set of APIs, webhooks, and a fully featured dashboard that includes a multi-chain wallet. These tools are perfect for building your crypto automations.

#### Use Cases

Here are some ideas for automations that you could set up:

1. Receive notifications on Slack for incoming transfers to your wallet.
2. Periodically check your wallet balance and automatically top-up gas.
3. Forward incoming transfers to another address.

#### Goal

This guide will show you how to use Zapier + WalletKit to set up an automation that forwards all incoming `MATIC` transfers to another address. For instance, if there is an incoming transfer of `1 MATIC`, we will transfer `1 MATIC` to our destination address.

Although we will be using Zapier in this guide, you are free to use any other automation tool or integrate with your own backend services.

#### Setup

1. Create your WalletKit account.
2. Create your Zapier account.
3. Buy a small amount of gas from the dashboard. You only need `0.01 MATIC`. We'll use much less.
4. You'll need a Polygon testnet wallet with some funds to send the MATIC that will be forwarded.

#### Steps Overview

At a high-level, you will be performing the following steps:

1. Create a Webhook Trigger in Zapier
2. Setup webhook with transfer events in WalletKit
3. Test the Zapier trigger
4. Add Zapier actions to make a transfer to the destination address

#### Zapier Trigger

Begin by making a new Zap. Next, choose the "Webhooks by Zapier" trigger with the "Catch Raw Hook" event.

Click “Continue” and Zapier will generate a URL for you. Note this URL for the next step.

#### WalletKit Webhook

Setup webhook in WalletKit for transfer events:

1. Go to the WalletKit dashboard.
2. Navigate to the Webhooks page.
3. Click “New Webhook”.
4. Use the URL from the previous step as the Target URL.
5. Check the box for Transfer events.
6. Click “Create Webhook”.

#### Test Transfer

To test the Zapier trigger, send a test transaction with some `MATIC` to your WalletKit wallet. You can find the wallet's address on the right side of the Overview page, labeled "Deposit Address".

After sending the `MATIC`, you can test your Zapier trigger. It should find a record like so:

Click “Continue with selected record”.

#### Forward Transfer

**Request Body**

Next, we'll make an action in Zapier. This action will take the `raw_body` data from the previous step and make the request body for the transfer call to WalletKit API.

Choose “Code by Zapier” as the Action and pick “Run Javascript” as the event:

Click “Continue”. Configure the “Input Data” and the “Code” like so:

Remember to update the recipient value to your intended destination address. Click “Continue” and test the action.

**Transfer API Call**

To make the forward transfer, we'll make an API call to WalletKit from our Zap.

In Zapier, add a new action by clicking the "plus" button at the bottom. Select "Webhooks by Zapier" and choose "POST" as the event.

Click on "Continue". In the next step, copy and paste this URL: `https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/tokens/transfer`. Select JSON as the Payload Type. Zapier will take the request body from the previous step automatically.

To finish, we need to authenticate the request. Go to the WalletKit dashboard, click on the API Keys page, and get the Project ID and the API Secret.

In Zapier, look for the "Basic Auth" field and type the Project ID, followed by "|", and the API Secret. Here is an example: `e40e8b79-79c8-4baf-b153-9fcf4ca26780|wkt_zabc123456`.

Click "Continue" and test the action.

#### Test

That’s it! Publish your zapier. Now, send transfers to the wallet and they’ll automatically get forwarded to the destination address.
