This endpoint creates a custom Token with provided metadata, and deploys the token on chain.

The creator of the token, which is the project wallet identified by the project API key,will be the admin of the token contract will can perform actions like `mint`.

> Often, youâ€™ll want to be able to divide your tokens into arbitrary amounts: say, if you own 5 GLD, you may want to send 1.5 GLD to a friend, and keep 3.5 GLD to yourself. Unfortunately, Solidity and the EVM do not support this behavior: only integer (whole) numbers can be used, which poses an issue. You may send 1 or 2 tokens, but not 1.5.
> 
> To work around this, ERC20 provides a decimals field, which is used to specify how many decimal places a token has. To be able to transfer 1.5 GLD, decimals must be at least 1, since that number has a single decimal place.

The created token's address can be found by [/transactions/status-by-id](/reference/get-transaction-status-by-id) endpoint once the transaction is succeeded.
