You can use WalletKit to submit raw transactions to the blockchain using simple HTTP APIs. WalletKit will manage your **wallet setup**, **transaction signing**, **gas estimation**, **nonce management**, and **resubmissions**. Once the transaction is submitted, you will get notifications for all transaction updates.

WalletKit provides higher-level APIs to submit common transactions like minting and transfers for tokens and NFTs. But this guide is focused on submitting raw transactions only.

#### Use Cases

You can use WalletKit to submit your transactions from your backend, lambdas, workers, scripts, or webhook handlers.

For example, if you want to make an on-chain transaction when an event occurs in your app, you can make a call to WalletKit to do so. Or let's say you want to airdrop tokens when a user signs up, you can do that as well.

#### Setup

Make sure you do the following first:

1. Setup your WalletKit account
2. Buy some gas. You can do this from the dashboard. Have 0.01 MATIC available, although we'll use a lot less.
3. Get the Project ID and the API Secret from the API Keys page in the dashboard

#### Submit Transaction

As an example, let's say we want to transfer 0.001 MATIC to `0xe883Cd7ADfe55CD84798a8129468e106b32CDC7A`. The raw transaction for this is:

JSON

`{
  "to": "0xe883Cd7ADfe55CD84798a8129468e106b32CDC7A",
  "value": "0x38D7EA4C68000"
} 
`

To submit a raw transaction, we will use the Sign and Send endpoint:

Shell

`curl --request POST \
     --url https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/transactions/sign-and-send
     --user <project id>:<api secret>
     --data '
{
  "network": "Polygon",
  "signer_wallet_address": "0xbfD206D1Fe1Cc447B9307777E7e5ec54DE2aE05b",
  "unsigned_transaction": {
    "to": "0xe883Cd7ADfe55CD84798a8129468e106b32CDC7A",
    "value": "0x38D7EA4C68000"
  },
  "secret": "testnet-secret"
}
'
`

#### Check Status

That's it! Your transaction has been submitted. You'll receive a transaction hash that you can use to check the transaction status. Or, you can subscribe to webhook alerts to get transaction updates.
