#### API Hosts

WalletKit exposes two endpoints, one for each environment:

1. Mainnet: `https://mainnet.usewalletkit.com`
2. Testnet: `https://testnet.usewalletkit.com`

#### Networks + Environments

Many endpoints require a `network` field to function. You can use network names such as `Polygon` or `Ethereum`. WalletKit will automatically resolve them to the proper network based on the API environment you're using.

For example, if you use `network=Ethereum` on mainnet (`https://mainnet.usewalletkit.com`), the network will resolve to Ethereum Mainnet whereas using `https://testnet.usewalletkit.com` will resolve to `Ethereum Sepolia`.

As a rule of thumb, use testnet for development/testing and mainnet for production.

Below, you can find a reference of the actual network that is resolved for each endpoint + network combination:

| Mainnet  | Testnet             |                    |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Polygon  | Polygon PoS Mainnet | Polygon PoS Mumbai |
| Ethereum | Ethereum Mainnet    | Ethereum Sepolia   |
